-- 1. Retrieve everything from a table
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities;

-- 2. Retrieve specific columns from a table
SELECT name, membercost
FROM cd.facilities;

-- 3. Control which rows are retrieved
SELECT *
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE membercost > 0;

-- 4. Control which rows are retrieved - part 2

SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE membercost > 0
AND membercost < monthlymaintenance / 50.0;

-- 5. Basic string searches
SELECT *
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';

-- 6. Matching against multiple possible values
SELECT *
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE facid IN (1, 5);

-- 7. Classify results into buckets
SELECT name,
       CASE
           WHEN monthlymaintenance > 100 THEN 'expensive'
           ELSE 'cheap'
       END AS cost
FROM cd.facilities;


-- 8. Working with dates
SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate
FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';

-- 9. Removing duplicates, and ordering results
SELECT DISTINCT surname
FROM cd.members
ORDER BY surname
LIMIT 10;


-- 10. Combining results from multiple queries
SELECT surname
FROM cd.members

UNION

SELECT name
FROM cd.facilities;


-- 11. Simple aggregation
SELECT MAX(joindate) AS latest
FROM cd.members;



-- 12. More aggregation
SELECT firstname, surname, joindate
FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate = (
    SELECT MAX(joindate)
    FROM cd.members
);
